# Authentication Redirection Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds proper redirection handling to the authentication system so that users are redirected to their intended destination after logging in.

## How it works

### 1. Auth Guard (`auth.guard.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Protects routes that require authentication
- **Enhancement**: Now captures the intended URL (`state.url`) when user is not authenticated
- **Behavior**: 
  - If user is authenticated → allows access
  - If user is not authenticated → redirects to `/auth/login?returnUrl={intended-url}`

### 2. Login Component (`login.component.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles user login
- **Enhancement**: Now reads the `returnUrl` query parameter and redirects to it after successful login
- **Behavior**:
  - Reads `returnUrl` from query parameters (defaults to `/apps/dashboard`)
  - Shows info message when redirecting to a specific page
  - After successful login, redirects to the intended URL

### 3. Auth Service (`auth.service.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages authentication state
- **Enhancement**: Removed conflicting redirect logic to let the guard handle all redirections
- **Behavior**: Only handles authentication checks, no longer redirects on its own

## Example Flow

1. User tries to access `/apps/membership` while not logged in
2. Auth guard detects user is not authenticated
3. Auth guard redirects to `/auth/login?returnUrl=/apps/membership`
4. Login page shows info message about accessing requested page
5. User enters credentials and logs in
6. After successful login, user is redirected to `/apps/membership`

## Features Added

### Query Parameter Handling
- `returnUrl` parameter is passed in login URL
- Login component reads and uses this parameter for redirection

### User Experience Improvements
- Info message shown when user needs to login to access a specific page
- Seamless redirection after successful authentication
- No loss of intended destination

### Error Handling
- Proper fallback to dashboard if no return URL is specified
- Consistent error handling in auth guard and login component

## Testing
To test this functionality:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to any protected route while not logged in (e.g., `/apps/membership`)
3. Verify you're redirected to login with the correct returnUrl parameter
4. Login with valid credentials
5. Verify you're redirected to the original intended page

## Files Modified
- `src/app/core/guards/auth.guard.ts` - Added returnUrl parameter handling
- `src/app/features/auth/login.component.ts` - Added returnUrl reading and redirection
- `src/app/core/services/auth.service.ts` - Removed conflicting redirect logic
